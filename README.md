# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

In this in depth guide you'll learn the tools, protocols, and frameworks for building full stack web3 apps, and most importantly - how to put everything together to lay the groundwork for building out any of your own ideas in the future.

Some of the tools, languages, and protocols we'll be covering include JavaScript, React, Next.js, Solidity, Hardhat, Polygon, The Graph, and Radicle.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
